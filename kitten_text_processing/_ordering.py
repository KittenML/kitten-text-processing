        Splits a sequence of tokens in a smaller sequences of tokens in a way that maximum number of composite
        tokens permutations does not exceed ``max_number_of_permutations_per_split``.

        For example,

        .. code-block:: python

            # setup normalizer with self.max_number_of_permutations_per_split=6
             tokens = [

            ]

        Date tokens contain 3 items each which gives 6 permutations for every date. Since there are 2 dates, total
        number of permutations would be ``6 * 6 == 36``. Parameter ``self.max_number_of_permutations_per_split`` equals 6,
        so input sequence of tokens is split into 2 smaller sequences.

        Args:
            tokens: a list of dictionaries, possibly nested.

        Returns:
            a list of smaller sequences of tokens resulting from ``tokens`` split.
